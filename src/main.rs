//! A caching, normalising front end for the ClearlyDefined definitions API.
//!
//! Sits between sbomify-action and api.clearlydefined.io and does three things
//! the client cannot do for itself:
//!
//!   * **absorbs an unreliable upstream** — retries a stall rather than
//!     recording it as "this package has no metadata", which is how a
//!     rate-limited or timed-out lookup silently produced a thinner SBOM;
//!   * **collapses duplicate work** — every user asking about the same package
//!     version shares one upstream fetch, rather than each paying for it;
//!   * **shrinks the answer** — a definition is up to ~190KB of per-file
//!     analysis and consumers read four fields of it.
//!
//! One upstream, on purpose. ClearlyDefined's curated data is CC0-1.0, which is
//! what makes caching and re-serving it unambiguous; the other sources
//! sbomify-action reads carry terms that do not obviously permit the same, and
//! a service that reflected arbitrary paths upstream would be a general proxy
//! for whoever found it. Neither is a gap to be filled later.
//!
//! Designed to sit behind a CDN. The Cache-Control it emits is the useful knob:
//! the edge does the geographic work, this process does the normalising and the
//! collapsing.
